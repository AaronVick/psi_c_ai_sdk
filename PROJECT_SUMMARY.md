# ΨC-AI SDK Project Summary

## Project Overview
The ΨC-AI SDK is a cognitive framework for building self-reflective AI systems based on the principles of coherence, contradiction detection, and schema evolution. It provides a sophisticated memory system with semantic understanding, allowing AI agents to maintain internal consistency and evolve their understanding over time.

## Completed Components

We have successfully implemented the core foundation of the ΨC-AI SDK:

1. **Project Structure and Setup**
   - Created the proper directory and package structure
   - Set up dependency management with setup.py and requirements.txt
   - Created comprehensive README and documentation

2. **Memory System**
   - Implemented `Memory` class for individual memory units
   - Created `MemoryStore` for memory management 
   - Implemented memory importance decay based on the formula: `I(t) = I_0 · e^(-λt)`
   - Added JSON serialization for memory persistence

3. **Embedding Engine**
   - Integrated with sentence-transformers for text embedding
   - Implemented caching to prevent redundant embedding generation
   - Added batch processing for efficiency
   - Created utility functions for vector operations

4. **Coherence Scoring**
   - Implemented coherence calculation based on the formula: `C(A, B) = cosine(v_A, v_B) + λ · tag_overlap(A, B)`
   - Created coherence matrix generation
   - Added coherence drift detection
   - Implemented functions to find coherence patterns

5. **Contradiction Detection**
   - Created keyword-based contradiction detection
   - Added advanced NLI model-based detection option
   - Implemented contradiction matrix visualization
   - Created utility functions to find and explain contradictions

6. **Example Code and Testing**
   - Created example scripts demonstrating core functionality
   - Added testing scripts for verifying package structure and imports
   - Successfully tested core memory and serialization functions

## Next Implementation Steps

The following components are next in the implementation roadmap:

1. **Reflection Engine**
   - Core reflection cycle based on coherence thresholds
   - Scheduling mechanisms to prevent unnecessary cycles
   - Utility functions to measure reflection effectiveness

2. **Schema Graph Builder**
   - NetworkX-based graph for representing memory relationships
   - Node/edge creation based on coherence scores
   - Visualization capabilities for schema exploration

3. **Auth Layer**
   - API key validation for secure usage
   - Integration options with external auth systems

## Mathematical Foundation

The ΨC-AI SDK is built on rigorous mathematical foundations:

1. **ΨC Function**
   - `Ψ_C(S) = 1 iff ∫_{t_0}^{t_1} R(S) · I(S, t) dt ≥ θ`
   - Where S is memory system state, R(S) is reflective readiness, and I(S, t) is memory importance

2. **Coherence Score**
   - `C(A, B) = cosine(v_A, v_B) + λ · tag_overlap(A, B)`
   - Where v_A, v_B are embedding vectors and λ is the weight for tag overlap

3. **Contradiction Detection**
   - `Contradict(A, B) = 1 if ∃k ∈ K: k ∈ A ∧ semantic_match(B), 0 otherwise`
   - Where K is the set of negation/contradiction keywords

4. **Memory Importance Decay**
   - `I(t) = I_0 · e^(-λt)`
   - Where I_0 is initial importance, λ is decay constant, and t is time since creation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Memory Management

```python
from psi_c_ai_sdk import MemoryStore

# Create a memory store
memory_store = MemoryStore()

# Add memories
memory_id1 = memory_store.add("The sky is blue")
memory_id2 = memory_store.add("Water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen")

# Retrieve memories
memory1 = memory_store.get_memory(memory_id1)
memory2 = memory_store.get_memory(memory_id2)

# Export memories
memory_store.export("memories.json")
```

### Coherence Calculation

```python
from psi_c_ai_sdk import MemoryStore, EmbeddingEngine, CoherenceScorer

# Initialize components
memory_store = MemoryStore()
embedding_engine = EmbeddingEngine()
coherence_scorer = CoherenceScorer(embedding_engine)

# Add memories
memory_store.add("Cats are mammals")
memory_store.add("Dogs are also mammals")
memory_store.add("Quantum physics is a branch of physics")

# Get all memories
memories = memory_store.get_all_memories()

# Calculate coherence matrix
coherence_matrix = coherence_scorer.calculate_coherence_matrix(memories)

# Find highest coherence pair
highest_pair = coherence_scorer.get_highest_coherence_pair(memories)
print(f"Highest coherence pair: '{highest_pair[0].content}' and '{highest_pair[1].content}'")
```

### Contradiction Detection

```python
from psi_c_ai_sdk import MemoryStore, EmbeddingEngine, ContradictionDetector

# Initialize components
memory_store = MemoryStore()
embedding_engine = EmbeddingEngine()
contradiction_detector = ContradictionDetector(embedding_engine)

# Add potentially contradictory memories
memory_store.add("The Earth is round")
memory_store.add("The Earth is not flat")
memory_store.add("The Earth is flat")

# Get all memories
memories = memory_store.get_all_memories()

# Find contradictions
contradictions = contradiction_detector.find_contradictions(memories)
for memory1, memory2, confidence, explanation in contradictions:
    print(f"Contradiction: '{memory1.content}' vs '{memory2.content}'")
    print(f"Confidence: {confidence:.4f}, Explanation: {explanation}")
```
