# ΨC-AI SDK Development Progress

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Project Structure
- Created directory structure with proper organization
- Set up setup.py with dependencies
- Created README with usage examples
- Created proper package imports and structure

### 2. Memory System
- Implemented Memory class for individual memory units
- Created MemoryStore for memory management
- Added importance tracking and decay over time
- Implemented JSON serialization for persistence

### 3. Embedding Engine
- Integrated with sentence-transformers for text embedding
- Implemented caching to prevent redundant embedding generation
- Added batch processing for efficiency
- Created cosine similarity calculation functions

### 4. Coherence Scoring
- Implemented coherence calculation based on the formula:
  `C(A, B) = cosine(v_A, v_B) + λ · tag_overlap(A, B)`
- Added coherence matrix generation for memory sets
- Implemented coherence drift detection over time
- Added functions to find highest/lowest coherence pairs

### 5. Contradiction Detection
- Created keyword-based contradiction detection
- Added optional NLI model-based detection
- Implemented contradiction matrix visualization
- Added functions to find and explain contradictions

## Example Code
- Created example demonstrating all implemented components
- Created a simple test script to verify basic functionality
- Successfully tested the memory system components

## Current Status
The project structure is now correctly set up with the first five components implemented. We successfully tested the core memory functionality, but the full example requires additional dependencies to be properly installed.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Fix Dependency Issues**
   - Consider using more widely available embedding models
   - Add proper error handling for missing dependencies
   - Create a virtual environment setup script

2. **Implement the Reflection Engine**
   - Build reflection cycle based on coherence thresholds
   - Add scheduling mechanisms to prevent unnecessary cycles
   - Create utility functions to measure reflection effectiveness

3. **Implement Schema Graph Builder**
   - Develop the schema graph using NetworkX
   - Add node/edge creation based on coherence
   - Create visualization capabilities

### Future Work
- Memory lifecycle management and advanced features
- Schema mutation and annealing systems
- Bounded cognitive runtime
- Value and alignment systems
- Cross-agent safety mechanisms
