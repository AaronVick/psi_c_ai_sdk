# ΨC-AI SDK Community Framework

This directory contains files related to the ΨC-AI SDK Community Contribution Framework, which establishes clear guidelines and procedures for external contributions, feature requests, and community extensions.

## Directory Contents

- **contribution_guide.md**: Comprehensive guidelines for contributing to the ΨC-AI SDK, including templates, review processes, and standards.
- **benchmark_registry.json**: Registry template for community-driven benchmarks that evaluate system performance.
- **extension_marketplace.json**: Registry template for community-developed extensions to enhance the SDK's functionality.

## Purpose

The Community Contribution Framework is designed to:

1. Facilitate high-quality contributions from the community
2. Ensure mathematical correctness and rigor in all contributions
3. Maintain scientific integrity of the ΨC-AI SDK
4. Provide clear processes for contribution, review, and inclusion
5. Foster a collaborative research and development community

## Mathematical Metrics

The framework incorporates key mathematical metrics to assess community health and implementation correctness:

### Community Health Score

\[
H_{\text{community}} = \alpha \cdot \text{PRs} + \beta \cdot \text{Issues} + \gamma \cdot \text{Citations}
\]

### Implementation Correctness Validation

\[
C_{\text{impl}} = \frac{|\text{tests passing}|}{|\text{total tests}|} \cdot \frac{|\text{math coverage}|}{|\text{total formulas}|}
\]

## Getting Started

If you're interested in contributing to the ΨC-AI SDK:

1. Read the [contribution_guide.md](./contribution_guide.md) to understand the process
2. Check the benchmark registry and extension marketplace to see current community efforts
3. Follow the appropriate templates for your contribution type
4. Submit your contribution following the prescribed process
