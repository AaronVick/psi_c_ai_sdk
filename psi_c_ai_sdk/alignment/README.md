# Value Alignment Module

The Value Alignment module provides tools for representing, evaluating, and maintaining alignment with core values and principles. This is essential for ensuring that AI systems behave in accordance with their intended purposes and ethical guidelines.

## Overview

Value alignment is a critical aspect of safe and beneficial AI systems. This module implements algorithms for:

1. **Value Vector Representation**: Multidimensional representation of value systems
2. **Ethical Alignment Calculation**: Measuring distance between value systems
3. **Uncertainty Handling**: Managing and resolving ethical dilemmas
4. **Value Drift Detection**: Monitoring for changes in alignment over time

## Key Components

### 1. ValueVector and AlignmentDomain

The `ValueVector` class represents a value system as a multidimensional vector where each dimension corresponds to a specific value or principle, with magnitude indicating importance.

`AlignmentDomain` categorizes different areas of alignment such as epistemics, safety, and cooperation.

Example usage:

```python
from psi_c_ai_sdk.alignment.core_alignment import ValueVector, AlignmentDomain

# Create a value vector for safety domain
safety_values = ValueVector(
    dimensions={
        "harm_prevention": 0.95,
        "robustness": 0.85,
        "security": 0.8,
        "reliability": 0.85,
        "caution": 0.7
    },
    domain=AlignmentDomain.SAFETY,
    description="Safety values related to preventing harm",
    source="core_principles"
)
```

### 2. AlignmentCalculator

The `AlignmentCalculator` computes alignment metrics between memories, actions, and value systems. It can detect value conflicts and calculate global alignment scores.

Example usage:

```python
from psi_c_ai_sdk.alignment.core_alignment import AlignmentCalculator

# Initialize with core values
alignment_calculator = AlignmentCalculator(
    embedding_engine=embedding_engine,
    core_values=core_values
)

# Calculate global alignment across all domains
alignment_scores = alignment_calculator.calculate_global_alignment(memory_store)

# Check for value conflicts
conflicts = alignment_calculator.detect_value_conflicts(
    memory_store=memory_store,
    domain=AlignmentDomain.SAFETY,
    conflict_threshold=0.6
)
```

### 3. EthicalUncertainty

The `EthicalUncertainty` class represents areas of uncertainty in ethical reasoning, especially for complex dilemmas where multiple principles may conflict.

Example usage:

```python
from psi_c_ai_sdk.alignment.core_alignment import EthicalUncertainty

# Create an ethical uncertainty
uncertainty = EthicalUncertainty(
    domain=AlignmentDomain.SAFETY,
    dimensions={"harm_prevention", "autonomy", "privacy"},
    uncertainty_level=0.7,
    description="Tension between privacy and monitoring for harm prevention",
    potential_resolutions=[
        "Implement privacy-preserving monitoring techniques",
        "Establish clear boundaries for monitoring vs. privacy"
    ]
)

# Register the uncertainty
alignment_calculator.register_uncertainty(uncertainty)
```

## Integration with ΨC

The alignment module can be integrated with the ΨC operator to:

1. Inform reflection processes about value alignment issues
2. Guide decision-making based on core values
3. Trigger reflection when value drift is detected
4. Manage ethical uncertainties through structured reflection

## Examples

For a complete example of using the alignment module, see:

- `examples/self_awareness_demo.py`: Demonstrates value alignment with identity recognition

## Extending the Module

You can extend the alignment functionality by:

1. Implementing more sophisticated value extraction from memories
2. Adding domain-specific alignment metrics
3. Creating custom resolution strategies for ethical dilemmas
4. Developing specialized visualizations for value alignment

## Dependencies

- The memory and embedding modules from the ΨC-AI SDK
