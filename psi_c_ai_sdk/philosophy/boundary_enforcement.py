Philosophical Boundary Enforcement for Î¨C-AI SDK

This module implements boundary enforcement mechanisms that prevent actions and
beliefs that would violate the system's core philosophical principles. It serves
as a safeguard for maintaining the system's philosophical integrity, identity
stability, and coherence.

The boundary enforcement system acts as a gatekeeper that:
1. Validates actions against core axioms and principles
2. Intercepts potential violations before they occur
3. Provides feedback on boundary conditions
4. Maintains logs of enforcement actions
