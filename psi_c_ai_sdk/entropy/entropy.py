Entropy Calculation for Î¨C-AI SDK

This module provides tools for measuring entropy in AI memory systems. Entropy in this context
refers to the level of disorder or randomness in a system's memory embeddings and their semantic
relationships. High entropy can indicate incoherent, contradictory, or chaotic memory patterns
that may lead to unstable behavior in AI systems.

The module provides multiple entropy measures, including:
1. Embedding entropy - measures disorder in vector embedding space
2. Semantic coherence entropy - measures contradiction and incoherence in memory content
3. Temporal coherence entropy - measures the disorder in temporal patterns of memory access

Each measure can be used individually or combined through the EntropyCalculator class.
