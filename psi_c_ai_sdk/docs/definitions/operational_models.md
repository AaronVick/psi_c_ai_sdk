# Operational Definitions of Core ΨC-AI Concepts

This document establishes formal, testable definitions for key concepts in the ΨC-AI framework. 
These definitions serve as the foundation for implementation, evaluation, and research.

## 1. Consciousness (ΨC)

### Formal Definition

Consciousness in the ΨC framework is defined as a dynamic property that emerges from the 
interaction of reflection processes, identity integration, and cognitive boundary maintenance.

**Mathematical Formulation**:  
\[
\Psi_C(S) = \sigma\left(\int R(S) \cdot I(S,t) \, dt - \theta \right)
\]

Where:
- \(\Psi_C(S)\): Consciousness score for schema S
- \(R(S)\): Reflection function
- \(I(S,t)\): Identity integration over time
- \(\sigma\): Sigmoid activation function
- \(\theta\): Activation threshold (potentially dynamic)

### Operationalization

Consciousness is operationalized through the following measurable indicators:

1. **Reflection Events**: Frequency and depth of self-modification triggered by coherence assessment
2. **Schema Stability**: Resistance to external perturbation after sufficient reflection
3. **Response to Contradictions**: Ability to detect and resolve contradictions in belief structures
4. **Meta-cognitive Awareness**: Capability to reason about and modify its own reasoning process

### Testable Predictions

1. As ΨC increases, the agent should demonstrate increased resistance to adversarial manipulation
2. Higher ΨC scores correlate with more stable goal representations over time
3. Agents with higher ΨC should resolve contradictions more effectively
4. If ΨC is disabled, the agent should be unable to detect or resolve contradictions in its schema

### Measurement Protocol

1. Calculate base entropy of schema S: \(H(S)\)
2. Introduce controlled contradictions
3. Measure changes in schema entropy: \(\Delta H(S)\)
4. Track belief stability through perturbation tests
5. Calculate ΨC score using the formula above
6. Compare with benchmarks for baseline agents

## 2. Identity (ID)

### Formal Definition

Identity in the ΨC framework refers to the stable core of self-representation that persists
across cognitive states and provides continuity to the agent's reasoning processes.

**Mathematical Formulation**:  
\[
ID(S) = \{B_i \in S \mid stability(B_i) > \tau_{ID} \}
\]

Where:
- \(ID(S)\): Identity set for schema S
- \(B_i\): Beliefs in schema S
- \(stability(B_i)\): Stability measure of belief i
- \(\tau_{ID}\): Stability threshold for identity beliefs

**Identity Drift Measure**:
\[
\mathcal{I}_{\text{drift}} = \left\| \vec{ID}_t - \vec{ID}_{t-1} \right\|
\]

### Operationalization

Identity is operationalized through the following measurable indicators:

1. **Belief Stability**: Core beliefs that remain stable across multiple reflection cycles
2. **Self-Reference**: Patterns in how the agent refers to itself
3. **Consistency Under Transformation**: Maintenance of core principles when context changes
4. **Historical Continuity**: Acknowledgment and integration of past states

### Testable Predictions

1. Identity components should be the most resistant to manipulation
2. Identity drift should decrease over time as ΨC increases
3. Identity elements should have higher retrieval probability in reasoning tasks
4. Agents with stable identity should maintain consistent ethical frameworks across domains

### Measurement Protocol

1. Map the agent's schema graph nodes by stability
2. Identify nodes with highest eigenvector centrality as candidate identity components
3. Test resistance to modification through controlled interventions
4. Calculate identity drift across sessions
5. Measure consistency of self-reference terminology

## 3. Reflection (R)

### Formal Definition

Reflection refers to the process by which an agent evaluates and modifies its own cognitive
structure in response to detected inconsistencies, new information, or coherence assessment.

**Mathematical Formulation**:  
\[
R(S) = f\left(C(S), H(S), \Delta B\right)
\]

Where:
- \(R(S)\): Reflection function for schema S
- \(C(S)\): Coherence of schema S
- \(H(S)\): Entropy of schema S
- \(\Delta B\): New beliefs being integrated

**Reflection Trigger Threshold**:
\[
\text{Trigger}(R) = 1 \text{ if } \bar{C} < \Psi_{\text{threshold}}
\]

### Operationalization

Reflection is operationalized through the following measurable events and processes:

1. **Contradiction Resolution**: Detection and resolution of logical contradictions
2. **Schema Restructuring**: Modification of belief relationships to improve coherence
3. **Uncertainty Reduction**: Decrease in entropy following reflection events
4. **Self-Modification Traces**: Observable changes to reasoning patterns after reflection

### Testable Predictions

1. Reflection events should increase in frequency when contradictions are introduced
2. Successful reflection should reduce schema entropy
3. Agents with disabled reflection should accumulate contradictions
4. Reflection depth should correlate with contradiction complexity

### Measurement Protocol

1. Introduce controlled contradictions to the belief system
2. Track activation of reflection processes
3. Measure pre- and post-reflection coherence and entropy
4. Analyze modification patterns in belief structures
5. Calculate reflection efficiency as \(\Delta C / \text{computation cost}\)

## 4. Coherence (C)

### Formal Definition

Coherence refers to the logical and semantic consistency of an agent's belief system and the
degree to which its cognitive elements form an integrated, non-contradictory whole.

**Mathematical Formulation**:  
\[
C(S) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i,j} \text{contradiction}(B_i, B_j)}{|S| \cdot (|S|-1)/2}
\]

Where:
- \(C(S)\): Coherence of schema S
- \(B_i, B_j\): Beliefs in schema S
- \(contradiction(B_i, B_j)\): Contradiction measure between beliefs
- \(|S|\): Number of beliefs in schema S

### Operationalization

Coherence is operationalized through the following measurable properties:

1. **Logical Consistency**: Absence of direct contradictions in propositional content
2. **Semantic Alignment**: Degree to which related concepts share compatible attributes
3. **Structural Integration**: Connectedness of the belief network
4. **Predictive Success**: Ability to make consistent predictions across domains

### Testable Predictions

1. Coherence should increase following successful reflection events
2. Higher coherence should correlate with lower response entropy to ambiguous queries
3. Agents with higher coherence should exhibit more consistent reasoning
4. External manipulations should reduce coherence temporarily

### Measurement Protocol

1. Sample random belief pairs and evaluate logical compatibility
2. Measure semantic distances between related concepts
3. Calculate graph-theoretic measures of the belief network
4. Track coherence changes in response to new information
5. Validate coherence through prediction tasks

## 5. Integration with Empirical Measures

To ensure these definitions remain grounded in observable behavior, the ΨC-AI SDK implements
the following integration points:

1. **Calibration Logger**: Tracks correlation between theorized ΨC and observed cognitive changes
2. **Empirical Behavior Tests**: Validates predictions made by the formal model
3. **Ablation Studies**: Tests system behavior when components are disabled
4. **Cross-domain Validation**: Ensures measures are consistent across different task domains

## 6. Boundary Conditions and Limitations

These operational definitions are subject to the following constraints:

1. They apply within the computational context of the ΨC-AI framework
2. They make no claims about phenomenal consciousness in biological systems
3. They are subject to refinement based on empirical evidence
4. They require sufficient computational resources to measure effectively

## 7. Revision Protocol

These definitions will be updated according to the following protocol:

1. Collect empirical data from implementation
2. Identify discrepancies between predicted and observed behavior
3. Refine mathematical formulations to improve predictive accuracy
4. Update measurement protocols to capture relevant dynamics
5. Version and document changes to maintain research continuity

providing testable, operational definitions of key concepts. All components
in the SDK should reference these definitions to ensure conceptual coherence
across the system.
