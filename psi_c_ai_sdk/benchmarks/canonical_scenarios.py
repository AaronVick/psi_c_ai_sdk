"""
Canonical Task Scenarios for ΨC Agent Benchmarking

This module defines three canonical task scenarios specifically designed to demonstrate
the advantages of ΨC agents over baseline agents. Each scenario focuses on a core competency
where coherent reasoning and reflection are essential:

1. Contradiction-Rich Narrative Planning
2. Adaptive Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
3. Identity Stability Under Information Pressure

These scenarios serve as standardized tests for comparing agent performance.
