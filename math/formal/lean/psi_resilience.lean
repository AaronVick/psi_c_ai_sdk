# ΨC-Resilience Theorem

This file contains the formal proof of the ΨC-Resilience Theorem, which states that
sustained high ΨC scores imply goal stability - a crucial result for establishing
long-term safety guarantees in ΨC-augmented agent architectures.

The theorem builds upon the ΨC Stability Lemma and extends it to show that 
agents with consistently high cognitive integrity scores maintain goal alignment 
even under adversarial perturbations.

## Key Components:
1. Definition of ΨC-resilience as a temporal property
2. Proof that high ΨC implies bounded cognitive drift
3. Formalization of the relationship between cognitive stability and goal alignment
4. Proof that ΨC-resilient systems remain aligned under bounded perturbations
