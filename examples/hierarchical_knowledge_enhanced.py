Hierarchical Knowledge Management - Enhanced Features Demo

This script demonstrates the enhanced features of the HierarchicalKnowledgeManager
including semantic search, finding related concepts, visualizing hierarchies,
and inferring relationships between concepts.

Note: This is a simplified demonstration that shows the enhanced API
without requiring the actual module to be installed.
