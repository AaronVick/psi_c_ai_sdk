# ΨC-AI SDK API Documentation

This directory contains the official API documentation for the ΨC-AI SDK, a comprehensive framework for developing cognitive AI systems that maintain coherent belief networks through schema integration.

## Using the Documentation

The documentation is organized into sections that cover various aspects of the SDK:

- **Getting Started**: Basic installation and setup instructions
- **Core Components**: Detailed documentation of the fundamental components (Memory, Schema, Coherence, etc.)
- **Advanced Topics**: Documentation for more complex features and use cases
- **Reference**: Comprehensive API reference and configuration options

You can navigate the documentation in several ways:
1. Start with the [index.md](index.md) file, which provides a full table of contents
2. Browse the directories directly to explore specific topics
3. Use the cross-references and links within the documentation to navigate between related topics

## Documentation Format

The documentation is written in Markdown format with the following conventions:

- Code examples are enclosed in triple backticks with language specification
- API method signatures include parameter types and return values
- Tables are used for attribute references and configuration options
- Usage examples are provided for all major components

## Contributing to the Documentation

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Style Guide**:
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Provide code examples for all major features
   - Include parameter and return value documentation for all methods
   - Use tables for attribute and configuration references
   - Follow existing formatting conventions

2. **Adding New Documentation**:
   - Create a new markdown file in the appropriate directory
   - Update the index.md file to include a link to your new documentation
   - Update the documentation progress section in index.md

3. **Updating Existing Documentation**:
   - Ensure your changes maintain consistency with the rest of the documentation
   - Update examples to reflect any API changes
   - Add appropriate cross-references to related documentation

4. **Documentation Testing**:
   - Verify that all code examples work with the current version of the SDK
   - Check that all links and cross-references are valid
   - Ensure that the documentation builds correctly if using a documentation generator

## Documentation Build Process

To build the documentation locally (if using a documentation generator):

```bash
# Example commands - adjust according to actual build process
cd /path/to/psi_c_ai_sdk
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
cd docs
make html
```

The built documentation will be available in the `docs/_build/html` directory.

## Documentation Roadmap

Our documentation roadmap includes:

- Completing all sections marked as "In Progress" or "Planned" in the index.md file
- Adding more comprehensive examples and tutorials
- Creating interactive examples where possible
- Adding diagrams and visual aids for complex concepts
- Improving the search functionality and cross-referencing
