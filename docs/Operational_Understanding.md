It serves as the authoritative reference for developers, researchers, and users seeking a deep understanding of how the system functions at both theoretical and implementation levels.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Core Formulations

#### 1. Coherence Accumulation Model (Formula #1)

The coherence accumulation model describes how schema coherence evolves over time, based on a logistic growth equation modified by entropy:

$$\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \alpha \cdot C(t) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{C(t)}{K}\right) - \beta \cdot H(M(t))$$

Where:
- $C(t)$ is the coherence value at time $t$
- $\alpha$ is the growth rate parameter
- $K$ is the carrying capacity (maximum coherence)
- $\beta$ is the entropy influence factor
- $H(M(t))$ is the Shannon entropy of memory probability distribution

**Implementation**: `calculate_coherence_accumulation()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 2. Shannon Entropy Calculation (Formula #2)

Shannon entropy quantifies the uncertainty in a memory distribution:

$$H(M(t)) = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(m_i) \log_2(p(m_i))$$

Where:
- $p(m_i)$ is the probability of memory $m_i$
- $N$ is the number of memories

**Implementation**: `calculate_shannon_entropy()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 3. Phase Transition Threshold (Formula #3)

The phase transition threshold identifies when a system undergoes structural changes:

$$\theta = E[H(M(t))] + \lambda_\theta \cdot \sqrt{Var(H(M(t)))}$$

Where:
- $E[H(M(t))]$ is the expected (mean) entropy
- $Var(H(M(t)))$ is the variance of entropy
- $\lambda_\theta$ is a scaling factor for variance influence

**Implementation**: `calculate_phase_transition_threshold()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 4. Memory Similarity Weight (Formula #4)

The similarity weight between two memories is calculated as:

$$w_{ij} = \cos(z(m_i), z(m_j)) \cdot \frac{f_{ij}}{1 + \alpha|t_i - t_j|}$$

Where:
- $\cos(z(m_i), z(m_j))$ is the cosine similarity between memory embeddings
- $f_{ij}$ is the co-reflection frequency
- $|t_i - t_j|$ is the absolute time difference between memories
- $\alpha$ is the decay factor for temporal distance

**Implementation**: `calculate_memory_similarity_weight()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 5. Self-Loss Function (Formula #5)

The self-loss quantifies deviation from optimal coherence:

$$L_{self} = \sum_i (C_i(t) - C_{opt})^2$$

Where:
- $C_i(t)$ is the coherence value for memory $i$ at time $t$
- $C_{opt}$ is the optimal coherence value

**Implementation**: `calculate_self_loss()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 6. Coherence Kernel (Formula #6)

The coherence kernel measures overall system coherence:

$$R(S_t) = \frac{1}{|E_t|} \cdot \sum_{(i,j) \in E_t} w_{ij} \cdot f_{ij}$$

Where:
- $E_t$ is the set of edges at time $t$
- $w_{ij}$ is the edge weight between nodes $i$ and $j$
- $f_{ij}$ is the co-reflection frequency

**Implementation**: `calculate_coherence_kernel()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 7. Gradient Descent Step (Formula #7)

Gradient descent optimizes coherence values:

$$\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = -\nabla L_{self}(C_i(t))$$

**Implementation**: `gradient_descent_step()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 8. Multi-Agent Coherence (Formula #8)

Multi-agent coherence calculates overall coherence in a multi-agent system:

$$R(S_t) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \cdot C_i(t)}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i}$$

Where:
- $w_i$ is the weight of agent $i$
- $C_i(t)$ is the coherence value of agent $i$ at time $t$
- $N$ is the number of agents

**Implementation**: `calculate_multi_agent_coherence()` in `schema_math.py`

#### 9. Gaussian Noise Addition (Formula #9)

Gaussian noise is added to gradients for robustness:

$$\nabla L_{self} = \mu + \xi, \xi \sim N(0, \sigma^2I)$$

Where:
- $\mu$ is the mean of the noise
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the noise
- $I$ is the identity matrix

**Implementation**: `add_gaussian_noise()` in `schema_math.py`
